The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by ROSHI.  If you visit any third party websites via a link on the Service, please review the terms and privacy policies of such third party websites, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites.

13.       Children's Privacy.  
The Service is not structured to attract individuals under the age of 13.  Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at gebi.roshi@gmail.com.

The security of Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us at gebi.roshi@gmail.com.

15.       In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy.  
If we enter bankruptcy (similar) proceedings or are acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information to a third party in connection with the foregoing event.

Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so to that extent certain exclusions set forth herein may not apply.  THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  ROSHI HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING BY STATUTE OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.  ROSHI DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE OF BUGS, SECURITY BREACHES, OR VIRUS ATTACKS.  THE SERVICE MAY OCCASIONALLY BE UNAVAILABLE FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, UPGRADING, OR OTHER REASONS.  YOU AGREE THAT ROSHI WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY THAT MAY RESULT FROM TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF THE INTERNET, SLOW CONNECTIONS, TRAFFIC CONGESTION OR OVERLOAD OF OUR OR OTHER SERVERS.  WE DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE OR GUARANTEE ANY CONTENT, PRODUCT, OR SERVICE THAT IS FEATURED OR ADVERTISED ON THE SERVICE BY A THIRD PARTY.    
19.2.   ROSHI DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE OR GUARANTEE ANY CONTENT THAT APPEARS IN A USER SUBMISSION, AND DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO, AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR, ANY SUCH CONTENT.
19.3.   YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ROSHI SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USER SUBMISSIONS OR CONDUCT (INCLUDING DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, OR NEGLIGENT CONDUCT) OF ANY SERVICE USER OR TEACHER AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.
19.4.   YOUR RELIANCE ON, OR USE OF, ANY USER SUBMISSION, OR INTERACTION WITH ANY SERVICE USER OR TEACHER, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SERVICE USER OR TEACHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE OR ANY USER SUBMISSION OR ANY BOOKING, YOU AGREE THAT ROSHI IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE.  ROSHI RESERVES THE RIGHT, BUT HAS NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR ANY SUCH DISPUTE.
19.5.   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN OUR PRIVACY POLICY, ROSHI DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY PROVIDE OR ACTIVITIES YOU ENGAGE IN DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

20.       Limitation of Liability.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW: (i) ROSHI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS OR OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ROSHI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, and (ii) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ROSHI FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS OR OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU TO ROSHI FOR USING THE SERVICE DURING THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO BRINGING THE CLAIM. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

21.       Indemnity.  
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ROSHI and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of, or inability to use, the Service; (ii) your User Submissions; (iii) your use of Prospective Guest Data which is not in accordance with applicable law (including without limitation all applicable privacy laws); (iv) your interaction with any Service user, Prospective Student, Student, Teachers; or (v) your violation of these Terms.

22.       Term and Termination.  
These Terms are effective until terminated by ROSHI or you.  ROSHI, in its sole discretion, has the right to terminate these Terms and/or your access to the Service, or any part thereof, immediately at any time and with or without cause (including, without any limitation, for a breach of these Terms).  ROSHI shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of the Service, or any part thereof.  If you object to any term or condition of these Terms, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.  Upon termination of these Terms, you shall cease all use of the Service.  This Section 22 and Sections 12 (Intellectual Property Rights), 13.3 (License to User Submissions), 18 (Privacy), 19 (Warranty Disclaimers), 20 (Limitation of Liability), 21 (Indemnity), 23 (Independent Contractors) to 26 (General) shall survive termination of these Terms.

23.       Independent Contractors.  
You and ROSHI are independent contractors.  Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between you and ROSHI.  You must not under any circumstances make, or undertake, any warranties, representations, commitments or obligations on behalf of ROSHI.

24.       Assignment.  
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by ROSHI without restriction or notification to you.
25.       Governing Law and Disputes.  
These Terms and the relationship between you and ROSHI shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to its principles of conflict of laws.  You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts, provided that ROSHI may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

26.       General.  
ROSHI reserves the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Service at any time.  These Terms shall constitute the entire agreement between you and ROSHI concerning the Service.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a party's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.  OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
